### Data Set Summary & Exploration

Numpy library was used to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

#### Visualization of the dataset.

Here is a biref visualization of the data set.  We can see  available classes below:

As we can see data samples are not uniformly distributed across all classes. Some classes have a lot more data samples. Also distributions are close for training, validation and test sets (slightly different for validation set). Because of this fact non-uniform distribution should not be a problem for the existing data. However, there is a risk that model will not be generalized well for additional data (for example samples from the web) as it can be over trained for the specific classes. We will try to address this issue during pre-processing step.

### Pre-process image data 

1. As a first step, I decided to deal with non-uniformly distributed data. The idea was to make balanced training set where all classes are represented with the same number of samples. I decided to make copies from the existing images with low number of samples. Additionally, to prevent exact same images appearing twice two additional transformations were selected to add some variety to the resulting set: 
* Randomly scaling image up with factor 1.0 - 1.25 
* Randomly rotating image using angle from -15 to 15 degree.

 These parameters above just worked best for me with some other choices.  
 As the result total number of training samples increased to 86430 
  
 Here is a sample of fake images generated using transforms provided:

2. Also to extend ability for the generalization I decided to extend data set using same transformation above for whole dataset three more times. As the result total number of training sample increased to 345720 (8040 images per class)

3. Analyzing images further I found that there is a huge variety of different image quality and contrast levels for the images:

Trying to deal with this issue and increase validation accuracy I used different techniques like converting images to different color spaces, histogram equalization and etc. One which appeared to work best is CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) (http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/daf/tutorial_py_histogram_equalization.html)  
 
 Here is how processed images look like:

4. The last step is a to normalize images. Interesting fact to mention there is that pixel / 255  normalization works significantly better than (pixel - 128) / 128 proposed as a sample.  

### Model Architecture  

My final model consist of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 Grayscale image   							| 
| Convolution 4x4     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 32x32x32 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 16x16x32 |
| Convolution 4x4     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 16x16x64 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 8x8x64 |
| Convolution 4x4     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 8x8x128 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 4x4x128 |
| Fully connected		| 2048x512        									|
| Dropout | keep_prob = 0.4        									|
| Fully connected		| 512x128        									|
| Dropout | keep_prob = 0.4        									|
| Fully connected		| 128x43        									|
| Softmax				|       									|

1. After pre-processing steps are done I tried initial LeNet model as a base - and results were slightly above 90% accuracy for the validation set. It appeared that adding  dropout layer for the first fully connected layer with keep_probability = 0.5 is a good starting point to improve model. Just with this small change I was able to archive 94% accuracy for the validation set with base LeNet model.

2. To archive higher accuracy results, I tried following options:
 * Adding new features maps to convolutional layers
 * Playing with padding types and filter sizes, tried following filter sizes: 4, 5, 6. Results are pretty close there. Selected 4x4 filters for the model
 * Playing with fully connected layers sizes. The selected size can be ssen in table above.
 * Finally decided to add one more fully connected layer - it slightly increased performance for the model.

3. For the training part of the model I decided to select AdamOptimizer as it uses momentum and adaptive learning rates and should work better when SDC.
  * While playing with batch sizes I realized that 128 batch size works slightly better than lager sizes as 256, 512, 1024. 
  * Trying different learning rate values (0.01, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001) I realized that 0.0005 works best for the model.
  * Also it looks like 50 - 100 epochs is enough for model to stop increasing validation accuracy reaching taring accuracy ~99.9% - indicating slight oferfitting.
 
After model is selected and tuned my final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 99.9%
* validation set accuracy of 98.1%
* test set accuracy of 96.4%

### Test a Model on New Images

There are six German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image6] ![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8] 
![alt text][image9] ![alt text][image10] ![alt text][image11]

I expected that two images might be difficult to classify: 
* Children crossing - because of a shadow and noisy background. 
* Beware Ice/Snow - because of the snow noise

Here is predictions results:

![alt text][image12]

The model was able to correctly guess 6 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 100%. This is higher compares to the accuracy on the test set of 96.7%.  Probably one of the reasons is that all signs provided are in pretty good quality. Also it is worth to mention the results are slightly different when training model with same parameters again. Some times after model is re-trained "bumpy road" sign is not predicted correctly.

It is surprising as "bumpy road" sign is a best quality sign :)   

Checking precision and recall on the test set we see that "Bumpy road" is a difficult sign for the model: 

* Bumpy road - Recall: 89.1667, Percision: 96.3964

So probably it is relevant result. Also interestingly "double curve" and "pedestrians" are most difficult signs for the model:  

* Double curve - Recall: 73.3333, Percision: 91.6667

* Pedestrians - Recall: 70.0000, Percision: 76.3636

Although - model predicted "double curve" correctly for the web image :)

From the other hand the "Turn right ahead" has excellent statistics:

* Turn right ahead - Recall: 100.0000, Percision: 100.0000

Let's look into the softmax probabilities for the web image predictions:

Model has almost 100% confidence about "Speed limit (30km/h)", "Yield" and "Double curve" signs. "Beware of ice/snow" sign" is also more than 96% confidence. It is not so sure about "Bumpy road" - 82% and just quesiing that "Children crossing" is valid with 31% probability.
